# **systemd-shutdown-cleanup**

Tutorial on how to create a system service to perform shutdown cleanup tasks
on systemd-based Linux distros.

## Overview

Shell scripting languages offer us a powerful tool to create scripts which
automate tasks in a Linux environment. Often, we may want these scripts to
trigger automatically when a system event occurs. Which is why it comes as no
surprise a common question I read online is: “how do I create a cleanup script
that runs on shutdown?”

On systemd-based Linus distros the method to accomplish this task is not
immediately obvious or intuitive if you are not familiar with how systemd
works. The goal of this tutorial is to help you create your own cleanup script
and an accompanying system service which executes it automatically on shutdown.

## Step One: Creating the Script



## Step Two: Creating the System Service



## Step Three: Verifying Operation



## Step Four: Customize!
